## Write At The Beginning
This file is an attempt to test my familiarity with github and website building. It has no real meaning

Don't feel surprised and don't be disappointed.

I have a lot to write about and a lot to learn.

So, why not start now? In the new year, 

of 2022. Where new hope begins.
